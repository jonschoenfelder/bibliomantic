**{{ site.title | capitalize }}** is a research blog collecting and sharing short pieces of writing on a range of library and information science topics. Here is a non-exhaustive list of such LIS topics:
* Reference and Research Support
* Critical Information Literacy
* Critical Pedagogy
* Theories of Knowledge
* Information Behavior in the Everyday and Academic
* Computer Mediated Information Seeking
* Scholarly Communication
* Knowledge Management Systems
* History of Library Systems and Bibliographic Apparatus
* Libraries as Institutions of Universal Education

The point is to be able to write continuously on topics that support the overall scholarly and research agenda I'd like to pursue while also being a chance to practice technical skills related to static website design and approachable web tools for scholarly communication.
