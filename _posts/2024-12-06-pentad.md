The Pentad of Kenneth Burke from [A Grammar of Motives](https://archive.org/details/grammarofmotives1945burk) gives us the dramaticist perspective of rhetoric. From this perspective we can approach writing as something to be analyzed and engaged. This introductory post will use the features of the Pentad as a guide to the reader and to the writer alike for what this blog is, where it is made, who made it, how they made it, and why it was made.

## *Act - What is it?*

Bibliomantic is best defined as a personal research blog, a collection of time-ordered pieces of short writing on subjects that support the professional activity of its creator. At a micro-level the posts are short notes (usually more than a few hundred words and rarely more than a thousand) on encounters with scholarly writing, pieces of news, ideas in circulation, and any of the other objects one encounters in the academic line of work. At a broader level, these accumulate into a network of relations— social, intellectual, scientific —which form a record of someone's research. As the grains of individual posts gather, linked to each other by different relationships and set in reverse chronological order, a reader should get a sense of what the writer is currently working on and what they're ultimately driving at.
Subject matter is essential to guiding how this material is organized and gathered, and I can make guarantees about this up front: I'm interested in what would broadly be called "library and information science" or LIS. If it is related to the function and operation of libraries, if it's related to the creation, dissemination, and use of information, it will find a happy home in this blog. Within that broad subject there are areas that are more keenly interesting to me, some of which I engage with regularly and others which draw my curiosity, but definitionally, this is an LIS research blog.

## *Scene - Where is it?*

## *Agent - Who does it?*

## *Agency - How is it done?*

## *Purpose - Why is it done?*
