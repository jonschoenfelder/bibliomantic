<p>Bibliomantic is a research blog by Jon Schoenfelder to collect and share short pieces of writing on a range of library and information science topics. Here is a non-exhaustive list of such LIS topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reference and Research Support</li>
  <li>Critical Information Literacy</li>
  <li>Critical Pedagogy</li>
  <li>Theories of Knowledge</li>
  <li>Information Behavior in the Everyday and Academic</li>
  <li>Computer Mediated Information Seeking</li>
  <li>Scholarly Communication</li>
  <li>Knowledge Management Systems</li>
  <li>History of Library Systems and Bibliographic Apparatus</li>
  <li>Libraries as Institutions of Universal Education</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is to be able to write continuously on topics that support the overall scholarly and research agenda Iâ€™d like to pursue while also being a chance to practice technical skills related to static website design and approachable web tools for scholarly communication. The goal is to use the blog as a way to build a sustainable scholarly practice while working as an instructional librarian in a small academic library. The initial blog was made from the <a href="https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages-b/">Go-Go GH-Pages Workshop</a> offered by <a href="https://evanwill.org/">Evan Williamson</a>.</p>
