    <h1>Bibliomantic: And LIS Blog</h1>
    <p>Bibliomantic is a blog for storing and sharing short-form writing for research in library and information science. This research fits into the context of an academic library at a small liberal arts college and from a professional perspective of an instructional services librarian.</p>
    <h2>What Kind of Writing Will You Find Here?</h2>
    <p>Library and information science represents a fairly large field with many divergent areas and specialties. While my current research interests are broad and not especially well-defined at the moment, there are several topic areas I'm currently interested in developing as a part of my professional activity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reference and Research Support</li>
      <li>Critical Information Literacy</li>
      <li>Critical Pedagogy</li>
      <li>Theories of Knowledge</li>
      <li>Information Behavior in the Everyday and Academic</li>
      <li>Computer Mediated Information Seeking</li>
      <li>Scholarly Communication</li>
      <li>Knowledge Management Systems</li>
      <li>History of Library Systems and Bibliographic Apparatus</li>
      <li>Libraries as Institutions of Universal Education</li>
    </ul>
